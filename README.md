This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving unsafe raw pointer manipulation. The `bug.rs` file contains code that directly modifies a vector's elements using a raw pointer.  This is unsafe because it bypasses Rust's memory safety guarantees, leading to potential undefined behavior. The `bugSolution.rs` file demonstrates how to correctly modify the vector without using unsafe code.
